This was my first encounter with the darker side of humanity and potentially my first encounter with the paranormal.

This is the story of a nightmarish encounter I had as a young boy living in Japan. I was a very quiet child and often kept to myself. That's why I often walked home alone which in hindsight was not the wisest of choices of a boy to do. However, both my parents worked and didn't have time to pick me up. So, to make it easy on everyone I would walk home from school.  

I was a young boy walking home about maybe 9 or 10 years old. I remember the rain was pouring down hard and not even my raincoat was of use. I was looking up at the light and eagerly awaiting it to turn signaling for me to walk across.

It felt like an eternity had past then a woman with a surgical mask walked up to me and shielded me with her umbrella. She asked me if I was okay, and I nodded we crossed together and then she tells me she had a question. She dressed in white and was covered by a long coat and her head was partially obscured by this round hat while her face was partly shielded by a surgical mask which I didn't think anything of at the time.

Then she pulled off her mask and asked me "Do you think I'm pretty?" I was mortified her face had horrible scars around the mouth. I was speechless and visibly frightened. This made her angry and she asked again "Do you think I'm pretty?"

In fear I shouted "Yes!" hoping this would make stop and leave me alone.

It didn't work and she screamed "Liar!" I insisted I wasn't lying but she said, "Well how about I make you pretty just like me?" next thing I know she took out a knife and swung it at me. So, I moved as fast I could dodge and run. The whole time I kept thinking I was going to die. Looking back I probably would have if I hadn't gotten so lucky.

I kept running eventually running blindly into the street barely getting hit by a car. I heard thump or something and quickly turned around seeing she had been hit by the car. I froze for a second thinking she was dead but as soon as the driver got out to check on her, she lifted up her head and gave me this crazed look like a rabid animal.

I ran once more and didn't stop until I got home. I never found out what happened my parents told me there had been a man hospitalized for multiple stab wounds but a woman matching her description never turned up. After that my parents drove me to and from school, but I would hear similar stories from other kids about a woman approaching them or their parents, neighbors asking them the same question "DO YOU THINK I'M PRETTY?"*Transcribed from tape labeled “Cassie”.*

**CASSIE:** Back in college, I used to work at one of those small, mom-and-pops video stores. Ya know the sort - all these large shelves behind the counter, full of old VHS cassettes and a porn section behind a curtain. It wasn’t a bad gig, really. The guy paid in cash, and I could work whatever hours.

One night, I worked the closing shift. Everything went fine, but it was one of those nights where I didn’t get home until sometime after eleven. I rented this cramped, two-bedroom apartment with a couple of classmates, all of us film majors. I think at least one of us graduated. I’m not sure, actually.

Anyway. They didn’t let us - well, let *me* smoke inside. So, I stepped outside. This was back when phones weren’t so smart, ya know? All I could do was send text messages and really low quality photos. Nothing like we’ve got now, ya know. But I’m standing in the alley behind our apartment, near all these garages, smoking and texting my boyfriend at the time. And while I’m waiting for him to reply, I hear this baby crying. By this time, it's almost midnight. Maybe even later. But I hear this crying, and it’s close. But I don’t see anyone outside - no mother, no father. Nobody. Just this baby crying somewhere. And then I get the idea to look up, like I’m expecting to see this crying baby flying over me, or something.

That’s when I saw it.

It wasn’t much bigger than a bird, whatever it was. But its wings were huge, and it had these two little feet. It wasn’t a bird, or a bat. Nothing like that. But it had these big ol’ wings, and it was holding a baby in these little feet, or claws, or whatever they’re called. But it’s circling up there, maybe forty, fifty feet up there with this crying baby in its claws. And it’s just going round and round for a minute, and the baby is crying and crying. And then, it let the baby go. I didn’t see where it fell, but I heard it. It sounded wet and hard, like someone dropped a watermelon that could cry. The crying stopped after that. But the thing just kept flying up there for another minute before it dove down and, I don’t know. Do you think it ate it, maybe? I’ve seen a documentary where birds would do that with shellfish, dropping a crab or whatever from up high to crack it open and eat the insides. Do you think that’s what that thing was doing? Trying to crack that baby open and eat what’s inside?

Whatever happened, I took a picture of the thing when it was still in the air. But it was so dark, and the camera on that phone wasn’t very good. But if you can do anything with it, I still have it in a box somewhere. I didn’t want to go take a picture of whatever happened to that baby. But I did hear the police coming sometime later in the night, after I went back inside. I didn’t tell them nothing. What was I going to say, ya know? Sorry, but this bat-thing scooped up that baby and dropped it out of the sky? I feel crazy enough thinking I saw what I saw, even though I still got that picture. That poor woman... I can still hear her crying and crying. It’s like she lost her mind. I guess I would too, if something flew off with my baby in the dead of night, dropped it like a rock, and ate it.
